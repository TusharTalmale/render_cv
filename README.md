## üìÑ API for PDF Generation

RenderCV utilizes a Next.js API route (`/api/generate-pdf`) to handle the conversion of resume data into a PDF. This typically involves:

1.  Receiving `resumeData` via a POST request.
2.  Generating LaTeX code from the `resumeData`.
3.  Compiling the LaTeX code into a PDF (e.g., using a library or a serverless function that runs a LaTeX compiler).
4.  Sending the compiled PDF back to the client.
